# Hello there!

Hi! I am Dennise! ðŸ‘‹

I started my interest in tech when I was in primary school where I experimented with scripting small programs. Since then, I have built a lot of projects using technologies and programming languages such as .NET, Python, React, Next.js and more!

## Becoming a nerd...

I started programming when I was 10 or 11 years old. Can't remember exactly how old I was when I started.

It all began when I was in primary school, there was a program that I was using and there was things that I need that wasn't there. My curious little brain thought, why doesn't it have it? Can I make it myself? How can one make a program? It doesn't just appear from nothing right? From there, it snowballed into who I am today, a freaking nerd at computers. ðŸ˜©
